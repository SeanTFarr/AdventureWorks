## Purpose

I created this repo document the new adventure into Power BI. The data screenshots are from taking the course Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence, with instructor Chris Dutton, that Excel Maven & Maven Analytics offers (purchased on Udemy.com). A friend of mine, Austen Marden, recommened it and it was excellent! I had dabbled in Tableau while in the Data Analytics course at UCF, but I hadn't worked with Microsoft's Power BI yet. This course provided a great opportunity to do so, while I was starting to implement what I learning into a report I was creating at work.

For the record: Adventure Works Cycle is a ficticious company and the data was provided by Microsoft for informational purposes only as an aid to illustrate a concept. 

## Some differences from Tableau

1. First thing I noticed was that all of the tools (filters, visualizations, and feilds) are on the right of the screen instead of the left.
2. Power BI seems to understand the Excel sheets better, in my opinion. I didn't have as many issues with the data when loading into Power BI
3. Power BI starts out with all visualizations being linked, whereas in Tableau I had to make the connections
4. In my opinion, Tableau's maps were a little cleaner, at least what I have expereinced so far.

There are several other subtle differences that I noticed, but they did not stand out as much as the 4 above.  

## AdventerWorks
This is not an exhaustive report on the how to in Power BI, but just what I was able to put together in this course. I know, too much talk, where are the visualizations....

### First, the Executive Summary page.

This page gives an overview of the products, the revenue from the products, the number of orders and returns, and a map of selling countries.

### The Product Detail page.

This page gives the data on the selected product. It defaults to the top product, but can be for any product on the list of products on the Exec Summary. On this page, you can see how projected prices would affect the selected item

To access another product, you would select an item on the product list on the Exec Summary page, then right click and select "Drill through" and "Product Detail"

This brings you to the Produt details of the selected product and see how it is doing based on current data as well as see any differences that could happen if adjusting the price.

### The Customer Detail page.

This page gives us the demographics of the customers of Adventure Works Cycles. It defaults to show all demographics and highlights the top customer.

WHen you click on a specific customer, the information on the specific customer is displayed.

## In the End...
In the end, both Tableau and Power BI are excellent and the choice between them really only boil down to your own preferences. I really enjoyed learning how Power BI works and will continue to use it. Not just from it becoming so comfortable after taking this course, but also due to my company switching over to it exclusively about 2 months ago :grin: .
